[Miho Nakayama's children's story]hello everyone.Miho Nakayama, who is currently active as an actress, is divorced.She also has a son with her ex-husband, Hitoshi Tsuji.However, her husband, Hitoshi Tsuji, has custody and says he is unable to visit her.About Miho Nakayama's child, who is said to have been abandoned.There are various rumors going around, but what is the truth?First, I would like to investigate the rumors surrounding this.As mentioned above, Miho Nakayama and Hitoshi Tsuji have one son.It seems that they have been living separately since their divorce, but let's take a closer look at Miho Nakayama and Hitoshige Tsuji's son.My name is Juto-san.Seinen Gakusei was born in January 2004.The name of the elementary, junior high and high school is Paris School, and the name of the school is unknown.My university is the University of Paris, but I transferred to a more advanced school.Miho Nakayama chose the name because she wanted it to be easy to pronounce in French, where she lived at the time.The date of his birthday is unknown as it has not been made public.Regarding my current school, I entered the University of Paris, the southernmost general university in France, in September 2022.It appears that he transferred to another educational institution in June 2023.The name of the school is unknown.If Mr. Shigeto went on to a school even more advanced than the University of Paris,There is something called Grandes Ecoles.Grandes Ecoles have been in France since their founding until now.A higher education institution recognized as a training school for technocrats.By the way, the University of Paris is in the category of general universities, and Frans Écoles can be considered.Many of these Grandes Écoles are science and engineering,There are educational institutions in the field of education, culture, and humanities, and there are educational institutions in the fields of digestion and administration.In Juto's case, he wanted to be a lawyer, so in the field of public administration, he graduated from the Paris Institute of Political Science and then entered the National Institute of Public Service, which is considered an elite course in that field.Many past French presidents have graduated from the National Academy of Public Administration.In any case, Juto is considered to be a very talented student.I'm really curious about what he'll look like next. When I looked into it, it seems that there are no enlarged facial images, only those from childhood.If you look at the photo, you can't see his face clearly because he's facing away from you, but he seems to have a cool face.In the photo, Hitoshi Tsuji is holding her, but I can't see his face.Now, there are outrageous rumors that Miho Nakayama's son may have Down syndrome, but the conclusion seems to be a hoax.Rumors seem to be popping up quickly that the children of famous people with little information may have Down syndrome.Looking at Hitoshi Tsuji's blog, there are no signs of developmental disorders at all.Her son, Juto, lives with his father, Hitoshi Tsuji, in Paris.Let's take a look at Hitoshi Tsuji's parenting techniques, including the father's lifestyle, child-rearing, and son's career path.On Tsuji Hitoshi's blog, there is an episode in which his son, who was worried about his career path, seriously considered becoming a lawyer.Japanese lawyers are valued highly when living in France, so it seems to be one of the most promising professions.Apparently my son Juto thought a lawyer would be more reasonable.Miho Nakayama gave birth to a son, but it seems they are currently living separately and have not been able to meet.I got divorced.As evidence of the reason for the divorce, a women's magazine reported that Nakayama was seen holding hands with musician Keiichiro Shibuya on a date while they were in the midst of divorce negotiations.This says it all.In other words, it seems that Miho Nakayama had an affair.Regarding this, in issue 10 of the magazine VIST, we break down the truth behind divorce.It seems like a pattern where when you are sick and feeling weak, someone you used to love shows up and your love is ignited.What is the reason why Miho Nakayama is said to have abandoned her son?On the internet, there are posts saying that Miho Nakayama abandoned her son or that she can't see him.I'm asking for a divorce,It seems that the husband is not acting unethically towards his wife.In this case, it would seem that the husband would have an advantage.However, Japanese law seems to give the wife, or mother, an advantage.However, this time, my husband became more serious. Therefore, it seems that her father, Hitoshige Tsuji, is currently raising his son, Juto. This seems to be the reason why Miho Nakayama is said to have abandoned her child.Miho Nakayama seems to be dissatisfied with what people say about her. She seems to want to claim that she didn't abandon her child. But this argument seems painful. This is a very troublesome story for my husband.There was an uproar when the public said that Hitoshige Tsuji's loyalty was the reason for the divorce. However, it seems that it was not just a matter of appearance.This was testified by an entertainment reporter who has been following the divorce scandal between the two.Before Nakayama and Tsuji's divorce talks were discovered, she had heard something interesting from a certain bar mom living in Osaka.The Urekko Shemale Corps from Osaka has held dinner parties with Mr. Tsuji several times through people in the music industry.There, I was told about the sexual circumstances surrounding the company's expansion, and since alcohol was involved, it seems like some pretty wild stories came out.That's when the entire group of transsexuals turned away all at once.The details of the lesbian play are said to be that Ms. Tsuji tried to live a night life not only by her outward appearance but also by her inner self.According to an entertainment reporter, he complained that he got angry when he offered him various toys.Miho Nakayama has long been known in the church as a stubborn and conservative person.Even though they were a married couple, this request may have been too high of a hurdle.Looking at it this way, Miho Nakayama keeps saying one-sided things, but another possible reason is the Hague Convention.Simply put, the Hague Convention states that it is best for children to continue living in their country of origin even after their parents divorce.By the way, France is a member of the Hague Convention.Based on this idea, Jute was born and raised in France, so it would be better for him to continue living in France. It is true that Japan will be a completely unknown country for Juuto, so it will be difficult at first.Moreover, if you are the child of Mr. Nakayama, who is involved in a divorce scandal, the public may look at you with curiosity.If you think about it that way, I think the idea of ​​a terrible mother who abandoned her child begins to look a little different.However, if you consider that he had no choice but to withdraw due to the circumstances mentioned earlier, you can see it in a different way.However, since my son is currently in France and Mr. Kata and Nakayama are in Japan, I am told that I will not be able to see my son.Well, there are many things being said about it in the world, but it seems that it is gradually starting to be seen in the living room.When Hitoshi Tsuji and her son, who lives together in Paris, were in elementary school, he once cried about his mother.After all, not having a mother around when you're an adolescent can make you feel lonely.However, in reality, from Hitoshi Tsuji's blog, it seems that the son does not want to meet the mother who abandoned him.On the other hand, for Hitoshi Tsuji, he worked hard to cook for his son,It seems that a lot of people sympathize with the way they engage in serious dialogue and the way they raise children.Miho Nakayama was born on March 1, 1970 and is currently 54 years old.Born in Koganei City, Tokyo, she transferred to Itabashi No. 5 Junior High School in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo when she was in her third year of junior high school, when her entertainment activities became more active.In high school, I entered Tokyo Metropolitan Kitazono High School part-time.I dropped out of school in the second semester of my first year to prioritize my entertainment activities.Active as a model from 1982 to 1984,Since 1985, she has been active as an actress, singer, and talent.His agencies are Box Corporation, Eyes Wave, and Big Apple.In 2002, I had a fateful encounter with Hitoshi Tsuji,Just eight months after they started dating, Miho Nakayama got married.After getting married, she moved her base to Paris and temporarily retired from entertainment activities.In 2004, she gave birth to her first son, and just when she thought she would lead a happy life,Their marriage ended in 2014.It was previously proven that Miho Nakayama's affair was the cause.The person Miho Nakayama is said to have had an affair with is musician Keiichiro Shibuya.It seems that many fans of Keiichiro Shibuya and Miho Nakayama were predicting that they would remarry.However, the two reportedly broke up without remarrying.I tried to find out about Miho Nakayama's current boyfriend.After her divorce from Tsuji Hitoshi, Keiichiro Shibuya became her boyfriend, and they lived together in Shibuya's apartment when Miho Nakayama was in Tokyo for work.Miho Nakayama has a son, and her ex-husband, Hitoshige Tsuji, has decided to keep him.However, she broke up with Mr. Shibuya and currently lives alone in Tokyo, so it seems that she does not have a boyfriend.It seems that he previously dated Toshihiko Tahara, Yoshimasa Inoue, Chiyo Taninoguchi, etc.Furthermore, in 2019, rumors surfaced that he was having an affair with Anis, the biggest mogul vocalist in a rock band.She is currently living alone in Tokyo and there are no rumors of her dating, so it seems unlikely that she will remarry.He seems to be putting work first now. How was that?This time, we focused on Miho Nakayama's personal life.Although she has divorced and is separated from her children, it seems that her children are growing up fine together with their father.Mr. Nakayama, where did you start living after your divorce?She is currently living in Tokyo, making a full-fledged comeback as an actress, and seems to be living a fulfilling life.It seems that there are no plans to remarry for a while.I would like to keep an eye on this in the future.Please let us know your thoughts in the comments.Thank you for your viewing.If you like this video, please subscribe to the channel and give it a high rating.Thank you for your viewing
